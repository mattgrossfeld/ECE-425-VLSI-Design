This directory contains Cadence layout, symbols, and schematic views
for vtvt_tsmc250

HOW TO RUN CADENCE VIRTUOSO AND COMPOSER
-----------------------------------------
This document is not intended to show how to run Cadence Tools.
For guidelines on how to run Cadence Tools (Virtuoso and Composer)
refer to the VTVT Site (www.vtvt.org) ->VLSI Design->Tutorials->Cadence at
http://www.vtvt.ece.vt.edu/vlsidesign/tutorialCadence.php


---------------------------------------------
SETUP VTVT_TSMC250 LIBRARIES IN CADENCE ICFB
---------------------------------------------
The dfII libraries in this directory are *.tar.gz files. Gunzip and untar the files
in order to acess their content. 
Follow these steps to install the libraries in your Cadence Library Manager
	1. Start ICFB with the NCSU Cadence Design Kit

	2. Copy any of the library directories into your Cadence run directory
		If you have the .tar files, untar them then move the directories to 
		the Cadence run directory.
		
	3. Add library to your Cadence Library Manager by adding this line to the cds.lib file
		DEFINE <LIBRARY_NAME>	<PATH_TO_LIBRARY_DIRECTORY>/<LIBRARY_NAME>
		i.e.: DEFINE vtvt_tsmc250 ./vtvt_tsmc250

	4. Attach library to TSMC_CMOS025_DEEP techfile
		If you are using the NCSU Kit, attach the library to NCSU_TechLib_tsmc03d
		In the CIW->Tools->Technology File Manager->Attach: 
			Design Library <LIBRARY_NAME>
			Technology Library: NCSU_TechLib_tsmc03d

	5. The standard cells views are now available in your Library Manager.

DIRECTORY CONTENT
-------------------
- vtvt_tsmc250.tar.gz: Layout, schematic and symbols of the standard cell library
- vtvt_tsmc250_dummymosispad.tar.gz: Dummy geometries for Tanner Research, Inc. I/O and corner pads
	The complete layouts of the Tanner I/O pads could be obtained from MOSIS website,
	specifically http://www.mosis.org/Technical/Designsupport/pad-library-scmos.html

- vtvt_tsmc250_nolabel.tar.gz: Contains:
	The same layout views from vtvt_tsmc250
	The same dummy pads
without the labels.

- vtvt_tsmc250_dummymosispad.gds: Dummy geometries for Tanner Research, Inc.
	I/O and corner pads, in GDSII format
	These dummy pads are not intended for use with actual designs. They are created
	only for the convenience of creating LEF files. Since the actual pad cells themselves,
	particularly the corner pad, are too large to be used easily in LEF file generation using
	abstract (the LEF file generation tool in the Cadence suite). Here the dummy pad cells
	are shown to allow for appropriate modifications by the user if needed. It must be noted,
	however, that these are not the actual layouts of the pads themselves, which have to be
	downloaded from MOSIS website.
	Additionally, all names (cells, pins) here use lowercase letters, since it is assumed that
	when the user imports the padsN" layout, the names are converted to lowercase first.
	
- Various GDS2 map files: 
	vtvt_nolabel.map: Importing GDSII file to obtain layout without
		text labels (converting text labels into cap_id)
	vtvt_SocE2df2.map: Exporting GDSII files from SOC Encounter. 
		Note that the labelling layers use imaginary numbers
	vtvt_tsmc250_StreamIn.map: Importing the provided GDSII files to dfII;
		Importing layouts from the PNR tool to the layout tool. Note that
		the labeling layers (text, res_id, cap_id, (metalX label)) have
		imaginary numbers.
