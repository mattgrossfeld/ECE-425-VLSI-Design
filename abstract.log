INFO (ABS-10011): Verifying Technology Data ...
*Error* (ABS-20005): There are insufficient metal layers defined in the current design. You must define at least two metal layers in the 'validLayers' subsection of the 'LEFDefaultRouteSpec' constraint group in the technology file and these layers must have the layer function 'metal' in the functions section. Then update the technology file and attach it again.

*Error* (ABS-20007): There are no vias specified in the technology file. Ensure that the selected constraint group has a ValidVias section or at least one via is specified in the standardViaDefs subsection of the viaDefs section in the technology file. In addition, ensure that the function argument is set to 'cut' for the via in the functions subsection of the layerRules section .
