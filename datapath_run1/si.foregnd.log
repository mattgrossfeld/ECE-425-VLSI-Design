INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-66): Module ports will be printed without the port ranges. If you
have split busses 
across module ports you may get an incorrect netlist. To
print module ports 
with the port ranges, set simVerilogDropPortRange = nil
either in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
WARNING (OSSHNL-117): Ignoring switch view 'schematic' of cell 'gnd' in library
'basic', as it does not contain
any instance. To netlist this cell, add this
switch view to the stop list or to
ignore any specific instance set the property
'nlAction' to value "ignore" on
this cell view.

WARNING (OSSHNL-117): Ignoring switch view 'schematic' of cell 'vdd' in library

INFO (VLOGNET-120): Using connection by order (implicit connections) for all the
stopping cells.

WARNING (VLOGNET-121): You are netlisting with the test fixture flag set to OFF.
This could result in possible timescale directive violations. No 
timescale
directive will be added by the netlister. Set the test fixture option to ON
before netlisting if there are such violations.
